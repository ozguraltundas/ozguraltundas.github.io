        <!-- PROJECT 1 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">Pink-Fruited Hybrid Tomato with High Iron & TSWV/TYLCV Resistance</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This project integrates agronomic traits, iron biofortification, and strong viral resistance to develop pink-fruited hybrid tomato varieties with high market value.</p>
                <p>The project aimed to create tomato cultivars that combine market-preferred pink fruit color, enhanced iron concentration, and resistance to major destructive viruses. Pink tomatoes have increasing demand especially in East Asia, motivating breeders to expand hybrid tomato portfolios. Iron biofortification was included to address global micronutrient deficiencies, as iron plays critical roles in human health such as blood pressure regulation and reduced cancer risk. Finally, TSWV and TYLCV resistance were targeted due to their devastating impact on tomato production and their ability to predispose plants to other pathogens.</p>
           
                <p><strong>Pink Tomato:</strong>Tomato exhibits a wide diversity in color, shape, and texture, and consumer preferences vary greatly across regions. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in demand for pink tomatoes, especially in East Asian countries such as China. To expand our customer portfolio and meet this growing market interest, we decided to develop a pink-fruited hybrid tomato variety.</p>
         <p><strong>Iron Biofortification:</strong>Iron is one of the most essential micronutrients for human health. Although many people meet their daily iron requirements through meat consumption, the rising cost of meat and limited accessibility in many regions create nutritional challenges. Therefore, we aimed to increase the iron content of tomato, which is one of the most accessible and widely consumed vegetables across the world.
Iron plays critical roles in human health, including regulating blood pressure (Chan et al., 2014) and lowering the risk of several cancers such as esophageal, breast, liver, lung, prostate, and colon cancers (Farvid et al., 2022; Ali et al., 2021; Stanaway et al., 2022). Adequate iron intake also provides protection against diabetes and insulin resistance (That et al., 2022). Additionally, iron contributes to maintaining a healthy gut microbiota by supporting microbial growth and improving intestinal balance (Xia et al., 2018). That’s why we aim to increase the Fe concentration of the tomato
</p>
      <p><strong>TSWV and TYLCV Resistance::</strong>TSWV and TYLCV are among the most destructive viral diseases affecting tomato production, causing substantial yield and quality losses (Sappah et al., 2022). In addition to their direct damage, infection by these viruses increases the plant’s susceptibility to other viral and bacterial pathogens. Considering both the direct and indirect harmful effects of these diseases, we aimed to develop tomato varieties that exhibit strong resistance to these viruses (Qi et al., 2021).</p>

        <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">Universal Positive Control for Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) in Tomato Breeding</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This project developed a universal PCR positive control that works across multiple disease-resistance markers, improving MAS accuracy and reducing cost.</p>
                <p>Molecular marker–based screening is fundamental for modern plant breeding. However, each disease resistance gene traditionally requires a separate positive control, increasing cost and technical complexity. This project produced a universal positive control compatible with screening for TSWV, Fol (1–2–3), ToMV, FOR, Meloidogyne spp. (Mi, Ma, Mj), TYLCV, and Verticillium dahliae. The product has a standardized concentration (30 ng/µL), and reference gel images and purity values are available for users. This system improves reproducibility, reduces error rates, and simplifies disease resistance screening pipelines in tomato breeding.</p>

        <!-- PROJECT 3 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">Stress Tolerance Enhancement in Wheat using <i>Piriformospora indica</i></button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This thesis project evaluates whether <i>P. indica</i> can reduce the harmful effects of salinity and boron toxicity in wheat and improve yield.</p>
                <p>Salinity and boron toxicity are two major abiotic stresses that frequently coexist and limit wheat productivity. Traditional solutions are slow or unsustainable, making microbial solutions increasingly valuable. <i>P. indica</i>, a growth-promoting root endophyte, is known to enhance stress tolerance and antioxidant defenses in many crops. This project assessed its impact on durum and bread wheat under combined stress. Results showed improved grain yield, lower Na⁺ accumulation, reduced membrane damage (lower MDA), and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX, GR, POD). Co-inoculation with AMF further amplified yield improvements—up to 41% in bread wheat and 50% in durum wheat—highlighting microbial synergy as a powerful tool for sustainable wheat production.</p>

        <!-- PROJECT 4 -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-header">Screening Potato Lines for PVX & PVY Resistance</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This project screened advanced potato breeding lines to identify genotypes carrying Rx and Ry genes that provide strong resistance to PVX and PVY.</p>
                <p>PVX and PVY are among the most economically destructive potato viruses, often spreading through seed tubers and causing significant yield and quality losses. This project analyzed breeding lines for major resistance genes. Some lines carried the Ry gene (PVY resistance), others carried Rx (PVX resistance), and a valuable subset contained both—ideal for developing multi-virus resistant cultivars. These results support faster, more accurate parental selection in potato breeding and reduce long-term yield losses caused by viral infections.</p>
