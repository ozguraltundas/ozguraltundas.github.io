        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            If you are reading this, I believe we may share something in common — maybe you are a graduate student, 
            a professor, a researcher, or one of my friends. I would like to tell you why I created this website.
            I believe science should belong to everyone — not to a small group. It should be 
            <strong>accessible, understandable, and shareable</strong>.  
            This website is my small contribution to that idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since my childhood, I have always been curious, wanting to understand every detail of how things work. 
            That curiosity is probably why I chose to pursue my academic career abroad. I grew up in a village, 
            surrounded by animals, plants, and nature — which shaped why I studied 
            <strong>agriculture</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I worked many different jobs — hotel reception, agricultural labor, produce handling — and I experienced 
            ups and downs like everyone else. But I also won Türkiye’s most prestigious fellowships twice, worked on 
            national research projects, applied for a patent, won competitions, and was selected as 
            <strong>“Employee of the Year.”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, I am a PhD student in the 
            <a href="https://schnablelab.org/" target="_blank">Schnable Lab</a> 
            at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, researching plant breeding, plant genetics, and 
            quantitative genomics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside the lab, I love horse riding, reading books, walking, football, and giving presentations.
            I also have a horse named <strong>Gece</strong> — my best friend. I even dedicated my master's thesis to him.
        </p>
