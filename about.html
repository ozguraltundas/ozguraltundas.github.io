        <h1>Who I Am</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            If you are reading this, I believe we may share something in common — maybe you are a graduate student,
            a professor, a researcher, or one of my friends. In any case, I would like to tell you why I created this website.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe science should belong to everyone — not to a small group. It should be 
            <span class="highlight">accessible, understandable, and shareable</span>.
            This website is my small contribution to that idea. I want to share my work with you and support open, clear scientific communication.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since my childhood, I have always been curious, wanting to understand the details of how things work.
            That curiosity is probably why I chose to pursue my academic career abroad. I grew up in a village, in a farming family,
            surrounded by animals, plants, and nature. That is why I chose <span class="highlight">agriculture</span> as my field of study.
        </p>

        <p>
            Life was not always easy. Like everyone else, I experienced ups and downs. I worked many different jobs outside my field —
            from hotel reception to agricultural labor and produce handling. But I also won Türkiye’s most prestigious fellowships twice,
            worked on national research projects, applied for a patent, won competitions, and was selected as 
            <span class="highlight">“Employee of the Year.”</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, I am a PhD student, hoping to deepen my skills and knowledge in 
            <span class="highlight">plant breeding, plant genetics, and quantitative genomics</span>.
            I am currently a member of the 
            <a href="https://schnablelab.org/" target="_blank">Schnable Lab</a> 
            at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of research, I love horse riding, reading books, playing football, walking, and giving presentations.
            I actually have a horse named <span class="highlight">Gece</span> — my best friend. I even dedicated my master’s thesis to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can check my CV if you’d like to learn more about my academic background.
