    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        If you are reading this, I believe we may share something in common — maybe you are 
        a graduate student, a professor, a researcher, or one of my friends. In any case, I 
        would like to tell you why I created this website.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe science should belong to everyone — not to a small group. It should be 
        <strong>accessible, understandable, and shareable</strong>. This website is my small 
        contribution to that idea. I want to share my work with you and support open, clear 
        scientific communication.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since my childhood, I have always been curious, wanting to understand every detail 
        of how things work. That curiosity is probably why I chose to pursue my academic 
        career abroad. I grew up in a village, in a farming family, surrounded by animals, 
        plants, and nature. That is why I chose <strong>agriculture</strong> as my field of study.
    </p>

    <p>
        Life was not always easy. Like everyone else, I experienced ups and downs. I worked 
        many different jobs outside my academic interests — from hotel reception to 
        agricultural labor and produce handling. But I also won Türkiye’s most prestigious 
        fellowships <strong>twice</strong>, worked on national research projects, applied for a 
        patent, won competitions, and was selected as “Employee of the Year.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, I am a PhD student, hoping to deepen my skills and knowledge in 
        <strong>plant breeding, plant genetics, and quantitative genomics</strong>. I am currently 
        a member of the 
        <a href="https://schnablelab.org/" target="_blank" style="color:#003366; font-weight:600;">
            Schnable Lab
        </a> 
        at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of research, I love <strong>horse riding</strong>, <strong>reading books</strong>, 
        <strong>playing football</strong>, <strong>walking</strong>, and <strong>giving presentations</strong>.
        I actually have a horse named <em>Gece</em> — my best friend. I even dedicated 
        my master’s thesis to him.
    </p>

    <p>
