    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Plant Breeding & Genetics at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln,
        working in the Schnable Lab under the supervision of Prof. James Schnable. My research focuses
        on maize genomics, quantitative genetics, and high-throughput phenotyping, with an emphasis on
        understanding the genetic architecture of complex agronomic traits.
    </p>

    <p>
        I develop reproducible pipelines that integrate large-scale phenotypic datasets (multispectral,
        physiological, and yield-related traits) with genomic and environmental information. My goal is to
        dissect genotype–phenotype–environment interactions and identify the genetic factors that contribute
        to improved crop performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my M.S. degree in Plant Biotechnology and contributed to
        several national projects supported by TÜBİTAK. During this time, I gained experience in QTL mapping,
        GWAS, molecular characterization, tissue culture, and genotype evaluation. I have presented my work
        at multiple national and international conferences.
